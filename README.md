## Description

This is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.
Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) and Node.js v16. Also inside is a Package.json for metadata and dependencies, which allow package managers like `npm init` to install. See installation and usage for proper use of the application. This site contains handlebars which are easy to use and reusable webpage templates. Also inside are model files for users, post and comment; associations are defined in index.js (example: Users can have many posts). Alot of the code structure are referenced through various excersizes (from: 14-MVC). This is to ensure a stable and working model view controller that meet many requirements.
